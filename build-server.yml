# Confused about Ansible roles?
# I was too. They're basically just a bit of naming convention magic.
# http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles.html#roles


# The following roles require 'sudo' and are executed as the 'vagrant' user.
# This is a security risk!
# Mitigation: Delete vagrant user after deploy. deploy user can still 'sudo', he just needs a password.

- hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars/defaults.yml
  sudo: True
  roles:
    - { role: deploy-user, tags: ['deploy-user'] }
    - { role: linux-prereqs, tags: ['linux-prereqs'] }
    - { role: postgresql, tags: ['postgresql'] }
    - { role: postgresql-db-user, tags: ['postgresql-db-user'] }


# The following roles don't require 'sudo' and are executed as 'deploy'.
# QUESTION: Isn't a bad idea to let 'deploy' run the application, if he has R/W access to binaries?
# Shouldn't we have 'provision', 'deploy', and 'execute' users? Hmm...

- hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars/defaults.yml
  sudo: False
  remote_user: "{{deploy}}"
  roles:
    - { role: rbenv, tags: ['rbenv'] }
    - { role: ruby, tags: ['ruby'] }

# Unfortunately we're hopping back and forth between root & deploy.
# Now that we have rbenv installed (as deploy), set up passenger (as root).
# If we install nginx before ruby, we'll have to restart the server at some far away point, which is messy.
# Just do it in the right order in the first place.
